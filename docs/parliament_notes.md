# Info On Australian Parliaments

Most parliaments in Australia are **bicameral**, which means they have two *houses*, or *chambers*, of parliament (e.g the *House of Representatives* (lower house), and the *Senate* (upper house) in the Federal Parliament).



Both the two Territories and Queensland have **unicameral** parliaments, meaning they only have one house/chamber of parliament. In this package, returning those chamber's stream URLs is done with `parliament.stream_url`, rather than `parliament.lower/upper_stream_url`, as there is only one chamber.
